Benefitting from the lightest EVO frame we’ve ever created and the most aggressive iteration of our Progressive XC Geometry to date, the S-Works Epic EVO LTD made a few calls and assembled a dream team supporting cast to offer a ‘capability-to-weight’ ratio that skips impressive and jumps straight to flat-out mindblowing. While the Epic EVO sees a seemingly modest 20-millimeter increase in suspension travel up front over its Epic stablemate and just 10-millimeters out back, we’ve worked overtime to make sure it’s been implemented in a way that’ll have you saying ‘Whoa!’ as soon as you hit your first stretch of singletrack.",
